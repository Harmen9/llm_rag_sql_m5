## Data

For more information see: https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/m5-competition/.

It used hierarchical sales data, generously made available by Walmart, starting at the item level and aggregating to that of departments, product categories and stores in three geographical areas of the US: California, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Besides the time series data, it also included explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events (e.g. Super Bowl, Valentineâ€™s Day, and Orthodox Easter) that affect sales.

The data is uploaded in respective tables:
| Original file | table name | description |
|----------|----------|----------|
|calendar.csv| calendar | Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold. |
|sales_train_validation.csv| sales | Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [d_1 - d_1913] |
|sell_prices.csv |sell_prices | Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date. |
